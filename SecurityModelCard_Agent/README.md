**NOTE: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS (WIP)**

**1. Install Required Libraries:**

You'll need to install the following Python libraries.  The easiest way to do this is using `pip`, the Python package installer:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2 crewai json logging
```

*   `PyPDF2`: For PDF manipulation, specifically text extraction.
*   `crewai`: The Crew AI framework.
*   `json`:  Built-in Python library for working with JSON data.
*   `logging`: Built-in Python library for logging.

**2. Crew AI Setup and Configuration:**

Crew AI requires a bit more setup since it interacts with language models.  Here are the general steps:

*   **API Keys:** You'll need API keys for the language model you want to use (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, etc.).  You'll get these from the respective provider's website.
*   **Crew AI Configuration:** You'll need to configure Crew AI to use your API keys.  The exact method depends on how you are using Crew AI.
    *   If you're using the cloud-based Crew AI platform, you'll likely set these up in your account settings.
    *   If you're using a local setup, you might need to set environment variables or create a configuration file.  Refer to the Crew AI documentation for specific instructions.
*   **Agent Initialization:**  In the code, the line `security_agent = Agent(...)` is where you initialize the Crew AI agent.  *This is where you'll provide your API keys and other configuration details.*  Here's an example (replace with your actual keys and model):

```python
security_agent = Agent(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Or another model you have access to
    api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY", # Or your API key for the LLM
    # Add any other tools or configurations as needed
)
```

**3.  PDF File:**

You'll need a PDF file that contains the security-related information you want to extract.  Make sure you have the correct path to this file.

**4. Running the Code:**

1.  Save the Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `security_card_generator.py`).
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4.  Run the script using:

```bash
python security_card_generator.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter the path to your PDF file. After you provide the path, it will attempt to extract the information and print the Security Model Card as JSON.

**5.  Troubleshooting:**

*   **API Keys:** Double-check that your API keys are correct and that you've configured Crew AI properly.
*   **Dependencies:** Make sure all the required libraries are installed.  If you get `ModuleNotFoundError` errors, it usually means a library is missing. Re-run the `pip install` command.
*   **Crew AI Errors:** If you encounter errors related to Crew AI, consult the Crew AI documentation for troubleshooting tips.
*   **JSON Parsing Errors:** If you see errors about JSON parsing, examine the output from the Crew AI agent.  It might give you clues about why the JSON is invalid.  The `logging.error(f"Agent Output: {result}")` line is there to help with this.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** If the extracted information is inaccurate or incomplete, the most likely culprit is the prompt you're giving to the Crew AI agent.  Experiment with different prompts to see what works best.  Clarity and specificity in your prompt are essential.
